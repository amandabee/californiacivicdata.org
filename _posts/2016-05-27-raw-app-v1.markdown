Today we're announcing the release of version 1.0 of the
[django-calaccess-raw-data](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/apps/calaccess_raw.html) library,
a major step towards our goal of making it easier to analyze the role of money in California politics.

Alongside the code, we're introducing [new, comprehensive documentation for CAL-ACCESS](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/calaccess.html),
the jumbled, dirty and difficult state database that powers our project. 

Both achievements are thanks to our growing crowd of open-source contributors,
which now numbers <b>nearly 150 journalists, computer programmers and other volunteers</b>.

The final sprint was aided by more than 50 people who participated in our fourth California Code Rush
event at [NICAR 2016 in Denver](/2016/03/07/code-rush-4/).

There, hackers like [Anthony Pesce](https://github.com/anthonyjpesce) contributed code to improve our Django application that downloads,
extracts and loads the state's massive database.

Others, like [Neil Bedi](https://github.com/nbedi) and [Maegan Clawges](https://github.com/mclawges22), marched
through the data column by column to help us beef up our documentation.

After all their work, our core team pulled together the finishing touches and
prepared today's release. To review the full list of changes to our code check out [the changelog](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/apps/calaccess_raw/changelog.html#may-2016).
The documentation is now available at [django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/).

### Why did this take so long?

The CAL-ACCESS database, maintained by California Secretary of State Alex Padilla,
is one of the most confusing systems we've ever encountered. 

For instance, its adminstrators think a column like the `SPLT_CD` table's `PFORM_TYPE`
is too self-evident to bother explaining.

Not enough to put you off? Imagine 1,466 more columns just like it.

To spare anyone else from having to sift through Padilla's outdated, incomplete
and inconsistent [documentation](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/calaccess/officialdocumentation.html) ever again, we've compiled [simple searchable explanations](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/calaccess/dbtables.html)
for each of the system's 80 data tables.

(Spoiler: The `PFORM_TYPE` column stores an ID referencing the parent filing form of a
given sub-itemization record. That's hard-won knowledge we puzzled out after hours of comparing
the database records against paper filings.)

We also meticulously mapped hundreds of cryptic abbreviations to
human-readable descriptions. No more hunting for which office code represents
"Supreme Court Justice" (Was it `SPM` or `SUP`?).

And we mapped [the dozens of different forms](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/calaccess/filingforms.html) submitted by campaigns and lobbyists to the tables where
their information is stored, the most complete connection between the two that we suspect has ever been published.

### Now what?

With the first major component of our project complete, we're excited to
begin work on the next link in our planned data pipeline: A ["processed data" app](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/apps/calaccess_processed.html)
that will refine the raw CAL-ACCESS data and shoehorn it into simpler data models
that are easier to query and analyze.

We're also beginning work on a public website where anyone will be able to
download the current or previous versions of the raw CAL-ACCESS data files
and eventually our processed data files.
