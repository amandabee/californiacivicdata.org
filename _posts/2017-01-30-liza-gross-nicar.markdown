The California Civic Data Coalition is proud to announce [Liza Gross](http://www.lizagross.com/) will join our leadership team at the [National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR) conference](http://ire.org/conferences/nicar2017/) in Jacksonville, Florida as our first scholarship winner.

She was selected by our leadership team from an impressive pool of journalists, students and scholars that [submitted applications](http://www.californiacivicdata.org/2017/01/05/nicar17-scholarship/) earlier this month.

Gross is an independent journalist and part-time editor at [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/) who writes frequently about the intersection between science and society, specializing in environmental, public and mental health. She’s also a reporter for the [Food & Environment Reporting Network](https://thefern.org/).

She’s written for other publications including The Intercept, The Nation, The New York Times, Discover, Science, The Washington Post and Slate. She first delved into the database tracking California campaign contributions for a 2011 story, [“Money to Burn,”](http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/money-to-burn/Content?oid=3042155), which revealed a $23 million chemical-industry lobbying campaign to defeat five bills designed to regulate flame retardants.

You can email Liza at [lizagross@gmail.com](mailto:lizagross@gmail.com). On Twitter she is [@lizabio](https://twitter.com/lizabio).

The annual NICAR conference, scheduled this year for March 2-5 in Jacksonville, is one of the world's top data journalism events. It offers training and discussion with hundreds of leaders in the field.

Past conferences have been home to [a series](http://www.californiacivicdata.org/2015/02/26/code-rush/) of events for our team. We’re looking to show their fruits this year by debuting several data products. We’ll also be offering a new training session on rapid data analysis with the Python programming language.
