The California Civic Data Coalition is offering a scholarship for a student or journalist from the state to attend
the annual [National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR) conference](http://ire.org/conferences/nicar2017/), scheduled for Jacksonville, Florida
from March 2-5, 2017.

The winner will join our leadership team at the world's top data journalism conference for training and discussion with
hundreds of others in the field.

Past NICAR conferences have been home to [a](http://www.californiacivicdata.org/2016/05/27/raw-app-v1/) [series](http://www.californiacivicdata.org/2015/02/26/code-rush/) of events for our team. We're looking to show their fruits this year
by debuting several new data products. We'll also be offering a new training session on rapid data analysis with the Python programming language.
