This morning I delivered a brief speech at [Media Party 2015](http://www.meetup.com/HacksHackersBA/events/223765925/), the annual
conference put on by the Buenos Aires chapter of Hacks/Hackers.

My message: Data journalists are raising their tech game. But to take advantage of our vibrant community and harness the potential for open-source collaboration, we need to:

* Identify the common tasks of newsroom data analysis where we're all reinventing the wheel
* Start open-source projects that try to tackle them once and for all
* Foster underappreciated open-source skills like ["dotadiw" design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), [software packaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_(package_management_system)), [[unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) and documentation writing

Today I took the position that the tedious and painstaking pipeline scripts journalists write to access, transform and load common public data sets like election results, crime reports and government spending are fertile ground for this approach. But I'm sure it could work in other components of our work as well.

As we've [written before](http://www.californiacivicdata.org/2014/09/24/pluggable-data/), this
approach is what originally animated our open-source project to master California's jumbled, dirty and difficult database tracking money in state politics.
