This morning I delivered a brief speech at Media Party 2015, the annual
conference put on by the Buenos Aires chapter of Hacks/Hackers.

My message: News nerds (i.e. hacks) have done smart things to raise their
tech game. But to take advantage of our vibrant community and the potential
for open-source collaboration, we need to:

* Lock in on the common building blocks of our work
* Foster a specific set of technical skills (i.e. ["dotadiw" design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), [software packaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_(package_management_system)), documentation writing)
