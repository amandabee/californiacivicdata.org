The California Civic Data Coalition is proud to welcome [Sahil Chinoy](http://sahilchinoy.com/) as its first student developer.

Chinoy, an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley, is joining our
open-source effort to master [CAL-ACCESS](http://cal-access.ss.ca.gov/), the
jumbled, dirty and difficult government database that tracks campaign finance
and lobbying activity in California politics.

While studying physics and economics, Chinoy also created stories, news applications and interactive graphics
for [The Daily Californian](http://www.dailycal.org/author/schinoy/).

Last summer he interned at the [Los Angeles Times Data Desk](https://twitter.com/LATdatadesk), one of the partners on the CAL-ACCESS project.  

You can email Sahil at [sahil.chinoy@gmail.com](mailto:sahil.chinoy@gmail.com). On Twitter he is [@sahilchinoy](https://twitter.com/sahilchinoy). On GitHub he is [sahilchinoy](https://github.com/sahilchinoy).

On weekdays Sahil and the coalition's leadership team can be found
in the [#california-civic-data channel](https://newsnerdery.slack.com/messages/california-civic-data/) of the [News Nerdery](http://newsnerdery.org/) Slack account.

His work is paid for by philanthropic funding from the Knight Foundation, the Democracy Fund, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Rita Allen Foundation. The grant was awarded last year when the coalition was named
winner of the [Knight News Challenge](/2015/07/22/knight-news-challenge/).
