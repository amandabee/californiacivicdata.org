Outline
------

- What we asked for
- Explain why it matters
- What they said
- Link to the full exchange on documentcloud
- This create needless obstacles between the public and the data.
- It now requires weeks or months of work to master the ins and outs
of the database
- The documentation they have is incomplete and doesn't explain usage
or how to properly calculate totals
- "Ask Matt"

- How the election and ballot measure links are not in the "full" dump
- That had to be
