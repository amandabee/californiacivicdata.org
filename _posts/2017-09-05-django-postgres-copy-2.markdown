Today the California Civic Data Coalition released a new version of [django-postgres-copy](http://django-postgres-copy.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/),
our open-source software library that empowers users of the Django web framework to more quickly load large pools of data into PostgreSQL databases.


Today we're releasing a new tool that connects postgresql's COPY output to Django and a new stremalineed interface.

The work of James gordon.

What the library does already.

What it does now.

The COPY TO that rapidly outputs.

The new Django manager.

How it plays a crucial role in our coming downloads site and the pipeline that powers it. Necessity if the mother of invention.

List all the other people who have contributed to it and give examples of their use cases.

If there are changes you'd like to see, go get involved on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/california-civic-data-coalition/django-postgres-copy).
