Outline
-------

* Our team is at the Atlanta Marriott for the 2015 NICAR conference.
* We brought dozens of tickets with us from our CAL-ACCESS project
* Close a ticket, win a prize
* If you've never contributed to an open source project before, this is your chance. Find us and we'll guide you through the process.
* If you have skills, see if you can conquer one of our harder tickets to win a bigger prize.
* The prizes (with photos)
** Small: Sticker
** Medium: Shirt
** Large: Nuggets
* Any large prizes remaining will be raffled off
* Who is our team? Names and photos.
* Where can you find us? Give a general location and mention that we'll be blasting on Twitter under #NICAR15
* Thumbnail history of the CAL-ACCESS project, where it comes from, why it's important and what our previous events have been.
* Link to a tutorial that shows you how to get the package setup on your local computer.
** We will need a cloud database for the people who don't have MySQL installed
** And maybe a MySQL backup with a curl install script for people who want to install it locally.
