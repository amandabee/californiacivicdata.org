Last month, [we launched](/2016/09/15/website-launch/) a new version of this website with a simple call to action: File a patch and win a prize.

The bounty for a confirmed bug report or merged pull request to [our open-source website](https://github.com/california-civic-data-coalition/django-calaccess-downloads-website) was a t-shirt with our new logo, seen below.

<figure style="margin: 28px 0; max-width:300px; float: right;">
    <img src="/img/tshirt.png" style="max-width:300px">
</figure>

The response was rapid. Today I'm proud to announce the winners, who added to the accomplishments of our open-source community, which now can claim contributors from more than 150 volunteers.

The winners are:

* [Michael Keller](https://twitter.com/mhkeller?lang=en), a Bloomberg reporter, who discovered a bug in our site's footer.
* [Stephen Suen](https://twitter.com/s2tephen), an MIT graduate on the job hunt, who fixed that bug.
* [Nelson Pecora](https://twitter.com/nelsonpecora), a New York Magazine developer, who upgraded our code to comply with the Python programming language's [official style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* [Christine Zhang](https://twitter.com/christinezhang), an Open News Fellow at the Los Angeles Times, who created a [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) out of our new logo to display in the corner of browser tabs.

If you want to get involved, there's plenty more to do as we continue our quest to master CAL-ACCESS, the jumbled, dirty and difficult database that track money in California politics.

Kick around our site. Try out our [new downloads](http://calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/downloads/latest/) and [documentation](http://calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/documentation/).
