Today we're announcing the release of version 1.0 of our [raw-data app](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/apps/calaccess_raw.html), marking a major milestone toward our goal of delivering bulk access to California state campaign finance and lobbyist disclosure data.

Thanks to a big boost by our XXX contributors, we've climbed out of beta mode, and we're now inviting more users to rely on our code to deal with [CAL-ACCESS](http://cal-access.ss.ca.gov/), California's messy campaign finance and lobbyist reporting database.

See the full list of changes [here](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/apps/calaccess_raw/changelog.html#may-2016).

### Read The Awesome Docs

Transparency is one of the guiding principles of this project, so for the past several months we've focused on picking up the slack for the administrators of CAL-ACCESS, who have allowed their documentation to grow stale and incomplete.

Maybe these admins thought column names like `PFORM_TYPE`, which is found on the`SPLT_CD` table, were just too self-evident to bother explaining. Of course, the `PFORM_TYPE` column stores an ID referencing the parent filing form of a given sub-itemization record. 

How could that be any more obvious?

To spare you from having to sift through the Secretary of State's old, incomplete and inconsistent documentation, we've published [our own docs](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/calaccess.html) with explanations and details about each of the 1,467 fields on the 80 raw CAL-ACCESS data files.

This includes meticulously mapping hundreds of cryptic abbreviated codes to their human-readable descriptions. No more hunting for which office code represents "Supreme Court Justice" (now was it `SPM` or `SUP`?). We've covered, not only the so-called "valid" codes buried in the official documentation, but also the values actually observed in the database fields and our best guess as to what they mean.

Our docs are &mdash; and will continue to be &mdash; the most detailed and up-to-date publicly available description of the CAL-ACCESS database. 

Period.

How can we be so confident? Because rather than manually typing out all these docs, we've integrated the descriptions and source material references into our data models. This means we can programmatically generate these documents and automatically detect any pieces that might be missing.

### Community-Powered Project 

A big shout out to the roughly 50 attendants of our fourth California Code Rush at NICAR 2016 in Denver. Marching database column-by-database column, code rushers made over 100 commits that helped us beef up our documentation.

Also, a special thanks to code rusher [Anthony Pesce](https://github.com/anthonyjpesce) of the Los Angeles Times Data Desk for laying the groundwork for our new archiving feature.

### Now what?

With the first major component of our project complete, we're excited to begin work on the next link in the data pipeline: A ["processed data" app](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/apps/calaccess_processed.html) that will refine the raw CAL-ACCESS data and shoehorn it into simpler data models that are easier to query and analyze.

We're also beginning work on a public website where anyone will be able to download the current or previous versions of the raw CAL-ACCESS data files and (eventually) our processed data files.

### How you can help

If you're a journalist covering California state politics or a political scientist eager to incorporate CAL-ACCESS data into your research, we want to hear from you. What questions would you expect to answer with these data? Give us a shout on [email](cacivicdata@gmail.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cacivicdata) or the #california-civic-data channel of the [News Nerdery Slack](http://newsnerdery.org/).
