Starting today, all pages and data downloads offered by the California Civic Data Coalition are available using HTTPS, the global standard for guaranteeing the confidentiality and integrity of Internet traffic.

That means that all traffic to our site will now be automatically encrypted.

Links to pages and bulk downloads now begin with "https" by default rather than "http."

For instance, a [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) request to download the file containing all of today's archive would look like this:

<input type="text" class="download-link input-monospace" style="font-size:14px;" value="$ curl -O https://calaccess.download/latest/clean.zip" readonly="">

The old http links should redirect to the new ones.

Upgrading to HTTPS also allowed us to begin serving our site using the new [HTTP/2](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2/) standard, which will bring the added benefit of speeding up the site.
