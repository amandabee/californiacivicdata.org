Gordon, a journalist and computer programmer, is taking charge of the coalition's
open-source effort to master [CAL-ACCESS](http://cal-access.ss.ca.gov/), the
jumbled, dirty and difficult government database that tracks campaign finance
and lobbying activity in California politics.

Gordon will be based in Columbia, Mo., in the offices of Investigative Reporters and Editors.
He will report to [the coalition's leadership team](/about/). All of his work will be
freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/california-civic-data-coalition).

While pursuing his master's degree at the Missouri School of Journalism,
Gordon was a research assistant in the database library of at IRE's National
Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting.

Gordon has also worked stints at KBIA-FM, mid-Missouri's NPR member station,
and on the projects team of The Dallas Morning News.

Previously he was a product manager for VAN, a voter contact and activist
organizing application used by campaigns across the U.S., Canada and other countries.

You can email Gordon at [gordon.je@gmail.com](mailto:gordon.je@gmail.com). On Twitter he is [@je_gordon](https://twitter.com/je_gordon). On GitHub he is [gordonje](https://github.com/gordonje).

On weekdays Gordon and the rest of the coalition's leadership team can be found
in the [#california-civic-data channel](https://newsnerdery.slack.com/messages/california-civic-data/) of the [News Nerdery](http://newsnerdery.org/) Slack account and the public [#californiacivicdata channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=californiacivicdata)
on freenode IRC.

His work is paid for by philanthropic funding from the Knight Foundation, the Democracy Fund, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Rita Allen Foundation. It was awarded last year when the coalition was named
winner of the [Knight News Challenge](http://localhost:4000/2015/07/22/knight-news-challenge/). IRE is acting as the coalition's fiscal agent.
