Last weekend, I traveled to the campus of San Diego State University to join [a
journalism workshop](http://ire.org/events-and-training/event/2819/) put on by [Investigative Reporters and Editors](http://ire.org/).

Dozens of students and journalists gathered from across Southern California &mdash; and even as
far as Mexicali, Mexico &mdash; to learn advanced online research techniques, receive Microsoft Excel
instruction and develop other skills during two days of training.

One of the offerings was a new class created by our team titled ["First Python Notebook: Scripting your way to the story."](https://github.com/california-civic-data-coalition/python-calaccess-notebooks/blob/master/first-python-notebook.ipynb)

Over three hours I walked about 20 students through the fundamentals of the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language by using the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) programming environment to interrogate data and develop a story.

Our subject: Contributions to campaigns for and again Proposition 64, a ballot measure asking California voters to decide if recreational marijuana should be legalized.

The data: Drawn from [this site's bulk download service repacking CAL-ACCESS](http://calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/downloads/latest/), the jumbled, dirty and difficult database that tracks money in California politics.

The complete script for the class is [now available online on GitHub](https://github.com/california-civic-data-coalition/python-calaccess-notebooks/blob/master/first-python-notebook.ipynb) for anyone to take at home or teach elsewhere. We're aiming to expand and improve it for future events, so if you give it a try I'd love to hear your feedback. Email me any time at [ben.welsh@gmail.com](mailto:ben.welsh@gmail.com).
